# Godot Engine — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | Godot 4.7.2 |
| **Installed at pin time** | Godot 4.7.2.stable.official.ed1daf0bf — installed 2026-10-01 at `C:/Users/Gustavo/Tools/Godot/`. Matches the pinned version. |
| **Release Date** | June 2026 (4.7), maintenance releases through August 2026 (4.7.2) |
| **Project Pinned** | 2026-10-01 |
| **Last Docs Verified** | 2026-10-01 |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |

## Knowledge Gap Warning

The LLM's training data likely covers Godot up to ~4.3. Versions 4.4, 4.5,
4.6, and 4.7 introduced significant changes that the model does NOT know about.
Always cross-reference this directory before suggesting Godot API calls.

## Installed-Version Gap Warning

The warning above is one-directional — it covers the **model** knowing less than
this pin. The reverse gap is real and `/setup-engine` §3 creates it deliberately
("pin the newer one and upgrade later"): this reference can sit **ahead of the
installed editor**, and an agent citing it correctly then emits APIs that do not
compile locally. **Check `Installed at pin time` above before trusting a
version-qualified claim** — `NOT DETERMINED` means the gap is unknown, not absent.
